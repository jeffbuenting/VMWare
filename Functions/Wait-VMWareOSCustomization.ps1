    .SYSNOPSIS
        Pauses execution until the OS Customizations have completed.

    .DESCRIPTION
        When using Powershell to create new VMware VMs and applying an OS Customization, the customization does not get applied until after the VM starts.  It make take awhile depending on the configuration.
        To prevent powershell from moving on and potentionally causing issues, you need to wait for the customization to finish.

    .PARAMETER VM
        VM the OS Customizations are being applied.

    .PARAMETER Timeout
        Timeout failsafe.

    .Example
        $VM = New-VM -Name ServerA -Template OSTemplate -OSCustomizationSpec 'WIN 2016 Sysprep'
        $VM = Start-VM -VM $VM
        Wait-VMWareOSCustomization -VM $VM

    .NOTE
        I got this from someone else.  Unfortunately I did not capture the link.  All credit to them.  I just updated this to work with the newer versions of PowerCLI.
